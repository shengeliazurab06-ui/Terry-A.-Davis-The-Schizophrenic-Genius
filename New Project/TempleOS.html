            TempleOS (formerly J Operating System, LoseThos, and SparrowOS) is a biblical-themed lightweight operating system (OS) designed to be the Third Temple from the Hebrew Bible. It was created by American computer programmer Terry A. Davis, who developed it alone over the course of a decade after a series of manic episodes that he later described as a revelation from God. TempleOS is an example of coding as an art form.

        <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">
            The system was characterized as a modern x86-64 Commodore 64, using an interface similar to a mixture of DOS and Turbo C. Davis proclaimed that the system's features, such as its 640x480 resolution, 16-color display, and single-voice audio, were designed according to explicit instructions from God. It was programmed with a custom C/C++ variant (named HolyC) in place of BASIC, and included an original flight simulator, compiler, and kernel.

        <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">
            First released in 2005 as J Operating System, TempleOS was renamed in 2013 and was last updated in 2017.

            Terry A. Davis began developing TempleOS circa 1993. One of its early names was the "J Operating System" before renaming it to "LoseThos", a reference to a scene from the 1986 film Platoon. In 2008, Davis wrote that LoseThos was "primarily for making video games. It has no networking or Internet support. As far as I'm concerned, that would be reinventing the wheel". Another name he used was "SparrowOS" before settling on "TempleOS".

            TempleOS is a 64-bit, non-preemptive multitasking, multi-core, public domain, open source, ring-0-only, single address space, non-networked, PC operating system for recreational programming. The OS uses 8-bit ASCII text and includes built-in 2D and 3D graphics libraries, running at 640×480 VGA resolution with 16 colors. It includes keyboard and mouse support. It supports ISO 9660, FAT32 and RedSea file systems (the latter created by Davis) with support for file compression. According to Davis, many of these specifications—such as the 640x480 resolution, 16-color display and single-voice audio—were instructed to him by God. He explained that the limited resolution was to make it easier for children to draw illustrations for God.

            HolyC (formerly C+), a pun on Holy See, is a variant of the C and C++ programming languages designed by Terry A. Davis specifically for the TempleOS. It functions as both a general-purpose language for application development and a scripting language for automating tasks within TempleOS.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">
            Design and features: HolyC is the just-in-time compiled language of TempleOS. It is an imperative, statically typed programming language, although it uses some object-oriented programming paradigms.
